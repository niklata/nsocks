Need a list of banned networks.
In particular, 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 should be banned by default.

Need a list of permitted client networks/hosts.
Everything not permitted should be banned by default.

Obviously the list of listening interfaces should be specified manually.
By default, listen to nothing (fail out).

Use splice() for connection routing.

Single-thread for speed.  Multithread makes absolutely no sense here.

Allow specification of outgoing interface for IPv4 and IPv6.

Cleanup of idle connections can be done via grace period system and
GC-style coloring.  It should collect at some regular interval that
adjusts downwards as a function of number of listening sockets.

chroot should be the default, like usual in my programs.

I don't care about authentication.

TCP and UDP should be supported.
